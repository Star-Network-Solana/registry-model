# Registry Model
**Solana (Rust) Educator Trust & Coordination Layer**  
**Draft v0.1**

## What This Repository Is

This repository defines the **Registry Model** for STAR Network — the trust and verification layer designed to help people **find, evaluate, and work with trusted educators for Solana (Rust) development**.

STAR Network addresses a structural gap in the Solana ecosystem: the absence of a **neutral system** that can:

- Define educator quality in a consistent way  
- Verify teaching capability using transparent criteria  
- Coordinate qualified Solana (Rust) educators for enterprises, institutions, and developer communities  

This repo exists to document the logic, terminology, and operating assumptions behind that system so the ecosystem can understand **how trust is established** and how the registry evolves over time.

## Why This Matters

Solana adoption is expanding rapidly, including across enterprise and institutional participants, while the supply of **qualified Solana (Rust) educators** has not scaled at the same pace.

Through ecosystem research and direct conversations with developers and enterprises, STAR Network has observed a recurring problem:

- Organizations want training, but cannot reliably verify educator quality  
- Educators lack a neutral way to make teaching credibility portable  
- The ecosystem lacks shared standards for “what good looks like”  

STAR Network is designed to reduce this friction by making educator quality **visible, verifiable, and interpretable**.

## How STAR Approaches the Registry (Phased by Design)

STAR Network is intentionally phased to prioritize **trust, clarity, and public-good infrastructure** before adding certification or marketplace scale.

The registry evolves in stages:

### Phase 1 — Standards & Human Verification (Foundation)
- Define educator quality frameworks  
- Establish teaching capability evaluation criteria  
- Run human verification and transparent reviews  
- Begin documenting educator profiles and signals  

### Phase 2 — Coordination (Practical Utility)
- Support enterprise and institutional training coordination  
- Improve educator discovery and matching  
- Build structured feedback loops and review cycles  

### Phase 3 — Blockchain-backed Registry (Portability)
STAR is designed to progress toward a blockchain-backed trainer registry where educators may have:

- Public profiles  
- Verifiable teaching history  
- Satisfaction signals  
- NFT-based credentials issued on Solana  

However, STAR does **not** begin with a fully on-chain registry. Blockchain elements are introduced gradually and transparently as governance and standards mature.

### Phase 4 — Train-the-Trainer & Accreditation (Long-Term)
Over time, STAR aims to:
- Support a structured Train-the-Trainer pathway  
- Develop benchmarking assessments for educators  
- Evolve into a recognized accreditation authority for Solana (Rust) educators  

---

## What This Repository Contains

This repository focuses on the model behind the registry, including:

- How educator credibility is defined and interpreted  
- What verification means (and what it does not mean)  
- How registry review cycles work  
- How satisfaction signals and history may be represented responsibly  
- How blockchain-backed credentials fit into the long-term roadmap  

This repository is the reference point for ensuring STAR Network remains consistent, neutral, and transparent as it evolves.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository is not:

- A bootcamp or content platform  
- A general-purpose hiring or staffing marketplace  
- A guarantee of educator performance or outcomes  
- An official Solana entity  
- A completed on-chain registry today  
- A public reputation leaderboard designed for virality  

STAR’s purpose is to build long-term ecosystem trust, not short-term growth signals.

---

## Status

**Status:** In Development (Draft / v0.x)

The registry model is being documented early to ensure:
- clarity before scale  
- trust before automation  
- transparency before authority  

As STAR’s standards work, Train-the-Trainer programs, and benchmarking systems mature, this repo will evolve accordingly.

---

## Relationship to STAR Network

STAR Network is an independent professional association initiative focused on building **trust, verification frameworks, and emerging standards for Solana (Rust) education**.

Within STAR:
- Standards and pedagogy foundations are developed openly  
- Registry logic is documented transparently  
- Coordination and credentialing evolve carefully over time  

This phased approach is designed to strengthen Solana’s developer onboarding capacity and support long-term ecosystem growth through high-quality, verifiable education.
