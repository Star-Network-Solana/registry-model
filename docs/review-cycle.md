# Review Cycle (Draft v0.1)
**Solana (Rust) Educator Registry**

**Status:** Draft — In Development  
**Owner:** STAR Network  
**Scope:** How registry profiles may be reviewed, updated, and maintained over time

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document describes the early approach STAR Network uses to think about **registry review cycles** for Solana (Rust) educator profiles.

It exists to:
- Make registry maintenance logic transparent  
- Prevent “one-time verification” from being misinterpreted as permanent  
- Support consistency across educator reviews  
- Create a foundation for future benchmarking, Train-the-Trainer pathways, and credentialing  

This document is informational and non-binding.

## 2. Why Review Cycles Matter

Educator credibility is not static.

Even highly capable educators may experience changes over time due to:
- shifting ecosystem tools and practices  
- changes in teaching frequency or focus  
- new delivery formats or audiences  
- long periods of inactivity  
- changes in reliability or professional availability  

A review cycle ensures that registry signals remain:
- current  
- interpretable  
- trustworthy  

---

## 3. Design Principles

STAR Network review cycles are designed around:

### 3.1 Transparency Over Automation
In early phases, reviews are human-led and documented clearly rather than automated.

### 3.2 Context-Aware Interpretation
Reviews consider:
- audience level
- training type (workshop vs cohort vs enterprise)
- educator scope and specialization
- recency of relevant activity

### 3.3 Neutrality and Non-Punitive Maintenance
Review updates are not intended to be punitive.  
They are meant to keep signals understandable and avoid stale representations.

### 3.4 “Status” ≠ “Ranking”
Status changes are informational signals, not competitive scoring.

## 4. Review Events (When a Review May Occur)

A registry review may be triggered by one or more of the following:

- Initial profile creation and verification  
- New evidence of teaching activity or delivery outcomes  
- Updates to educator scope (topics, availability, focus area)  
- Significant ecosystem changes affecting relevance  
- A structured quality or standards update within STAR Network  
- Verified feedback inputs related to delivery performance  
- Periodic maintenance review to prevent outdated signals  

The goal is to maintain credibility without requiring constant updates.

---

## 5. What a Review Typically Considers

A review may consider alignment with the registry criteria dimensions, including:

- Solana (Rust) technical relevance  
- Teaching and instructional capability  
- Pedagogical method and clarity  
- Professional practice and reliability  
- Profile completeness and interpretability  

Reviews are designed to prioritize **observable indicators** rather than self-assertion.

---

## 6. Possible Profile Status Labels (Informational)

To support clarity without creating rankings, profiles may carry a status label such as:

- **In Review** — profile is being evaluated under current criteria  
- **Verified (Early Phase)** — profile has been reviewed and aligns with documented criteria  
- **Active** — educator is currently available or recently engaged  
- **Inactive / Not Currently Reviewed** — profile is retained, but recency is unclear or review is overdue  
- **Updated** — profile has been revised following a review event  

These labels are meant to improve interpretability rather than imply superiority.

---

## 7. Change Logs and Transparency Notes

Where appropriate, STAR Network may maintain light transparency notes such as:
- last reviewed date  
- a high-level “review summary” (non-sensitive)  
- whether a profile is pending update  

The intention is to preserve trust while respecting privacy and avoiding unnecessary exposure of internal deliberation.

---

## 8. Handling Feedback and Satisfaction Signals (Future-State)

STAR Network is designed to gradually incorporate **satisfaction signals** and verified teaching history over time.

In early phases:
- satisfaction signals are not treated as a single objective measure  
- feedback must be interpreted with context (audience level, constraints, goals)  
- feedback collection methods should remain transparent  

Any formal satisfaction signal format or representation standard will be documented separately as governance matures.

---

## 9. Relationship to Train-the-Trainer and Benchmarking (Future-State)

The registry review cycle is designed to support long-term professionalization mechanisms, including:

- Train-the-Trainer programs to develop educator capability  
- Benchmarking tests to confirm technical and pedagogical currency  
- Periodic re-evaluation to maintain relevance as Solana (Rust) evolves  

Where future benchmarking is introduced, the review cycle will adapt to incorporate it transparently.

This document does not define any benchmarking criteria or exam processes.

---

## 10. Relationship to Blockchain-backed Registry and Credentials (Future-State)

STAR Network is designed to progress toward a blockchain-backed registry where educators may hold:
- public profiles  
- verifiable teaching history  
- credential signals issued on Solana  

However:
- the registry does not begin as fully on-chain  
- blockchain elements are introduced gradually  
- credential issuance requires mature governance and standards  

The review cycle described here forms part of the foundation that makes future credentialing meaningful.

## 11. Draft Status & Iteration Plan

This is **Draft v0.1**.

Expected evolution includes:
- clearer definitions of review triggers  
- consistent review templates and documentation structure  
- alignment with early coordination engagements  
- refinement based on ecosystem feedback and observed outcomes  

Updates will prioritize trust, neutrality, and clarity.

---

## 12. Interpretation Notice

This document is a transparency artifact and is non-binding.

It should not be interpreted as:
- a guarantee of educator performance  
- an accreditation system  
- a final governance policy  
- an official Solana endorsement  

Its purpose is to make registry maintenance understandable and auditable.
